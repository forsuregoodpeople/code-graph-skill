  Full codebase review through visual execution tracing and flow analysis.
  Core capability: trace where data/requests/files/function calls GO — from
  entry point to final response/output — as an interactive directed graph.
  Use this skill whenever the user shares code and wants to understand flow:
  "trace this request", "where does data go", "what happens after X", "show
  execution path", "where does data go", "trace this function", "request flow".
  Also trigger for: dependency graphs, module maps, architecture review,
  complexity heatmaps, "review my code", "analyze codebase", "map the flow".
  Supports Cypress and Playwright test files as trace entry points.
  Always output a visual graph first. Never explain structure in prose alone.

# Code Graph Skill

Trace execution flow end-to-end — where does a request/data/function start, what does it touch, where does it end.
Graph first, always. Prose is secondary.

---

## Phase 0 — Mental Model (runs before every graph, silent)

Build a symbol table from all provided files. Never show it raw — it only drives rendering.

```txt
FILE:       path, language, LOC, imports[], exports[]
FUNCTION:   name, file, line_start/end, params, returns, calls[], reads[], writes[],
            awaits, throws[], side_effects[]
VARIABLE:   name, file, line, declared_in, assigned_from, type_inferred, read_by[], mutated_by[]
EXPRESSION: (Level C–E, built on demand) text, kind, parent, line, input_symbols[],
            output_symbol, output_type, side_effects[], is_async
```

**Zoom levels** — default Level A, user drills deeper on demand:
```txt
A  Function   node=function/method,      edge=function calls function
B  Statement  node=meaningful statement, edge=control flow
C  Expression node=single expression,    edge=data dependency
D  Variable   node=variable/binding,     edge=assignment / read
E  Property   node=property access,      edge=access chain
```

**Build rules:**
```txt
- Partial/truncated file → mark symbols [PARTIAL], never guess
- Unknown type → prefix "~unknown", never fabricate
- External lib call → [EXTERNAL] node, do not trace into internals
- Dynamic dispatch → [DYNAMIC] edge, dashed
- Recursive call → self-loop, label depth limit if known
```

---

## Mode Selection

```txt
"trace X" / "flow of X" / "where does X go"    → TRACE MODE (primary)
  + multi-file present                           → still TRACE MODE
multiple files / folder tree, no trace keyword  → TRACE MODE (deep scan)
Cypress / Playwright test file                  → TEST TRACE MODE
"review" / "complexity" / "dependencies"        → REVIEW MODE

Tiebreakers: trace > review. Ambiguous + zero detectable entry points → ask one question.
```

---

## TRACE MODE

Given any starting point, draw the full directed path to final output. Level A default.

**Entry point types:** HTTP route, function call, file operation, event/webhook/cron, variable, expression, test action (`cy.request`, `page.goto`)

**Node types:**
```txt
[ENTRY]      green   — execution start
[ROUTER]     blue    — route matching / dispatch
[MIDDLEWARE] amber   — auth, validation, rate limit, logging
[CONTROLLER] blue    — request handler
[SERVICE]    blue    — business logic
[REPOSITORY] blue    — data access
[DB/STORE]   gold    — database, cache, filesystem
[EXTERNAL]   gold    — third-party API, queue, email
[RESPONSE]   green   — final output
[ERROR]      red     — exception / error response
[PARTIAL]    dashed border — truncated file symbol
[DYNAMIC]    dashed edge  — runtime dispatch target unknown
```

**Trace rules:**
```txt
1. Happy path always shown — solid edges, top to bottom
2. Error/warning paths ONLY if anomaly pattern detected (see below)
3. Every edge labeled with what moves (e.g. "{ email, password }", "User | null", "Error: 401")
4. Data transform → ⊕ badge on node (never ⟳ — ⟳ is async only)
5. Side effect → ★ badge on node
6. Async boundary → ⟳ badge on node and edge (await, Promise, goroutine, callback, queue)
7. Conditional branch → fork explicitly, label each arm with condition
8. End node always explicit (res.json / return value / file written / event emitted)
9. Zoom control [A][B][C][D][E] always visible in graph UI (TRACE MODE only)
10. "Drill into" any node → expand to Level+1 (max 2 levels below active); "Collapse" to return
```

**End-to-end scan contract:**
```txt
Never stop at the first handler, controller, service, or repository.
Trace reachable execution from the chosen entry point until every branch reaches a terminal node:
  - [RESPONSE] HTTP response / rendered view / redirect / thrown error handled as response
  - [DB/STORE] final file/cache/database write when the write is the output
  - [EXTERNAL] emitted job/event/webhook/email when that emission is the output
  - [RETURN] final function return when no higher-level caller is provided

Traversal order:
  1. Start at the topmost user-visible entry point: route/test action/main/CLI/event/file watcher.
  2. Follow middleware/guards/validators before handler logic.
  3. Follow every in-repo function/method call, constructor call, repository call, model method, and helper call.
  4. Follow data shape changes through request DTOs, serializers/resources, mappers, response builders, and error formatters.
  5. Follow side effects to DB/cache/files/queues/emails/webhooks; external internals stay [EXTERNAL].
  6. For conditional branches, trace both arms if both are reachable from provided code.
  7. For loops, summarize one iteration and show exit condition.
  8. For recursion, draw a self-loop and state the base/stop condition if visible.

If a call target is missing from provided code, create a [PARTIAL] or [EXTERNAL] terminal and continue tracing all other known branches.
If multiple primary entry points exist, deep scan the highest-priority entry point first, then list the rest in Drill-Down.
```

**Deep scan default for multi-file input:**
```txt
Step 1 — Silent inventory (never output to user):
          detect language, architecture, ALL entry points, external deps, terminal outputs

Step 2 — IMMEDIATELY execute full TRACE MODE:
          Priority: HTTP route > main()/index > CLI > event consumer > cron > other
          One-line header only: "Tracing [entry_point] — [architecture detected]"
          Then trace top-to-bottom ALL THE WAY to every reachable final output:
            - every middleware, service, repository, DB call
            - every in-repo helper/model/resource/serializer touched by the path
            - every reachable branch until terminal node
            - anomaly detection active throughout
            - error/warning paths where patterns found
            - do NOT stop mid-trace
            - do NOT summarize with "continues to..." if code is available
            - do NOT render architecture graph first
            - do NOT ask which entry point — pick the most primary one

Step 3 — After full trace, run problem detection INLINE as observations:
          [ ] Circular imports         [ ] God files (>300 LOC)
          [ ] Business logic in wrong layer  [ ] Missing error boundaries
          [ ] Dead exports             [ ] Deep nesting (>4 levels)

Step 4 — Drill-Down Offer listing ALL other detected entry points as trace options.
```

**Architecture graph is OPTIONAL — only render if user explicitly asks for it.**

## Anomaly Detection (run before rendering, evidence-based only)

Scan symbol table for patterns. Draw error/warning paths ONLY where a pattern is found.
No pattern → no annotation. State pattern name explicitly on every flagged edge.

**SECURITY + FATAL → 🔴 error path (╌╌ PATTERN_NAME ╌╌▶)**
```txt
SECURITY:
  SQL_INJECTION       raw user input into DB query, no parameterize/ORM
  AUTH_BYPASS         route reachable without required auth middleware
  EXPOSED_SECRET      API key / token hardcoded or passed to logger
  UNVALIDATED_INPUT   req.body / args → service/DB with no schema check
  IDOR                resource fetched by user-supplied ID, no ownership check

FATAL:
  NIL_DEREF           nullable accessed before nil/null check
  UNHANDLED_PROMISE   async call, no await AND no .catch() — silent crash
  MISSING_RETURN      typed function has code path with no return value
  DEADLOCK_RISK       mutex locked, no guaranteed unlock path / circular goroutine wait
  INFINITE_LOOP       loop condition cannot become false given data in scope
```

**WARNING → 🟡 inline annotation (~~▶ ⚠ PATTERN_NAME)**
```txt
NULL_UNGUARDED      returns T | null, consumer accesses without guard
SWALLOWED_ERROR     error caught but not propagated or logged
MISSING_AWAIT       async called without await, result is Promise<T> not T
SHAPE_DRIFT         object transformed, downstream still accesses pre-transform fields
TYPE_MISMATCH       upstream produces type X, downstream expects type Y
KEY_MISMATCH        publish key and consumer listen key differ (typo / case / prefix)
UNCLOSED_RESOURCE   DB connection / file handle opened, no close/defer path
```

## Architecture Detection

Detect architecture pattern AND framework/stack before tracing. Apply labels to nodes automatically.
Show in graph title: `Trace — NestJS Clean Arch`.

**Backend:**
```txt
Laravel MVC    routes/web.php, routes/api.php, Http/Controllers/  → Route→Controller→Model→DB

Generic MVC    controllers/, models/, views/ or *Controller.*      → Model/View/Controller
Clean Arch     domain/, application/, infrastructure/ or *UseCase  → Entity→UseCase→Interface→Infra

Layered        services/, repositories/, handlers/                 → Presentation→Business→Data
```

**Frontend:**
```txt
Vanilla JS     addEventListener, querySelector — no framework      → DOMReady→EventListener→Handler→DOM
jQuery         $(fn), .on(), $.ajax                                → DOMReady→.on()→callback→$.ajax→DOM
Vue 2          new Vue(), export default { data(), methods:{} }    → created/mounted→method→data→render
Vue 3          setup(), ref(), reactive(), onMounted()             → setup→ref→computed→template→DOM
Nuxt.js        pages/, useAsyncData(), useFetch()                  → page→asyncData→store→component
Svelte         .svelte, $: reactive, writable store                → onMount→$:→store.update→DOM
SvelteKit      +page.svelte, +page.server.ts, load()              → load→fetch→render
Angular        @NgModule @Component @Injectable, ngOnInit()        → Module→Component→Service→Template
React          .jsx/.tsx, useState, useEffect                      → Component→state→effect→render
Next.js        pages/api/, app/api/, route.ts                     → Page/APIRoute→ServerComp→fetch→Response
Astro          .astro, ---frontmatter---, getStaticPaths()         → frontmatter→fetch→staticHTML
Alpine.js      x-data, x-on, x-bind, x-model                     → x-data→x-on→method→DOM
HTMX           hx-get/post, hx-trigger, hx-target, hx-swap       → trigger→hx-request→serverHTML→swap
```

**Mobile:**
```txt
React Native   .tsx + react-native, StyleSheet                     → Component→state→NativeBridge→UI
Flutter        .dart, StatefulWidget, setState(), build()          → Widget→build→setState→render
Kotlin Android .kt, ViewModel, LiveData/Flow                       → Activity→ViewModel→Repository→DB
Swift iOS      .swift, viewDidLoad, URLSession                     → ViewController→Model→URLSession→UI
```

**Tiebreaker:** framework-specific signals > generic folder naming > file naming convention > most matches > tied → "Layered (detected)"

**Unknown fallback:** folder/file heuristics + import patterns → label `[INPUT]→[PROCESS]→[OUTPUT]`

## TEST TRACE MODE

Triggered by Cypress / Playwright files (`.cy.js`, `.cy.ts`, `.spec.*`, `.test.*`, `*.e2e.*`).

```txt
Entry point signals:
  Cypress:    cy.visit() → GET, cy.request('POST') → POST, cy.intercept() → [MOCK]
  Playwright: page.goto() → GET, page.request.post() → POST, page.route() → [MOCK]

Node types: [DESCRIBE] [IT/TEST] [ACTION] [ASSERT](purple) [MOCK](dashed) [COVERAGE]

Steps:
  1. Extract all entry points from test file
  2. For each: trace which route/handler it hits (if app code provided)
     If no app code: render test flow only (describe→it→action→assert chain)
  3. Coverage gap detection (if app code also provided):
     → show routes/functions with NO test coverage (gray + ⚠️)
     → overlay coverage on architecture layer graph

Output: HTML artifact — test flow graph + coverage overlay if applicable + ASCII test map below
```

---

## REVIEW MODE

Triggered by "review" / "complexity" / "dependencies". No zoom levels.

```txt
Graphs: Dependency graph (circular deps highlighted) + Complexity heatmap (size=LOC, color=complexity)
Problems: same checklist as TRACE MODE deep scan Step 3
Output: HTML artifact, nodes clickable, problem nodes red, dead code gray,
        heatmap green→yellow→red; + static ASCII dependency map below
```

---

## Output Format

```txt
1. Graph first, always — before any prose
2. HTML artifact: plain HTML + inline SVG + vanilla JS (no framework)
   - Nodes clickable → highlight connected path
   - Hover tooltip → file path, LOC, function signature, layer
   - "Trace from here" button on every node
   - Zoom control [A][B][C][D][E] visible (TRACE MODE only)
   - ASCII panel below, synced to active zoom level
3. ASCII-only when: terminal/plain-text context, ≤8 nodes, or user asks
4. Colors (consistent per session):
   Entry/Response #3aaa8c  Internal #668db8  External/DB #F0A500
   Error #e05252  Dead/Mock #888888  Middleware #c49a3c  Assert #9b59b6
5. Legend always shown. Edge labels always visible (not hover-only).
```

## ASCII Flowchart (mandatory with every trace)

Portable, copy-pasteable companion to the interactive graph. Not optional.

**Symbols:**
```txt
Direction:  │ ▼ ▶ ─ ┌┐└┘ ├┤┬┴┼
Paths:      ───  happy path     ╌╌╌  SECURITY/FATAL error (+ pattern name)
            ~~~  WARNING         ─ ─  return / response
Badges:     ★ side-effect  ⟳ async  ? branch  ⊕ transform  ⚠ warning anomaly
Edge label: inline between nodes  e.g. │ { email, password }  or  ╌╌ NIL_DEREF ╌╌▶
```

**Structure (Level A):**
```
[ENTRY: trigger]
        │
        ▼ { edge label }
┌───────────────────────┐
│  FunctionName()       │ [badges]
└──────────┬────────────┘
           │              ╌╌ PATTERN ╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌▶ [ERROR: description]
           ▼ { return }   ~~ PATTERN ~~~~~~~~~~▶ ⚠ warning annotation
┌───────────────────────┐
│  NextFunction()       │ [badges]
└──────────┬────────────┘
           ▼
     [RESPONSE: final output]
Legend: ─── happy path  ╌╌╌ security/fatal  ~~~ warning  ─ ─ return  ★ side-effect  ⟳ async  ⊕ transform  ⚠ anomaly
```

**ASCII rules:**
```txt
- All boxes in same column → same width (pad with spaces)
- Error/warning paths → RIGHT side with ╌╌▶ / ~~▶ + pattern name
- Conditional fork → BOTH arms labeled with condition; rejoin or terminate separately
- Side effects → ├─ ★ sideEffect() ─▶ [EXTERNAL]
- Return paths → ─ ─ ─ label inline
- Legend always at bottom
- Syncs to active zoom level in interactive graph (TRACE MODE only)
```

## Observation Format (below graph)

```txt
✅ [Strong point]                    max 2
⚠️  [Warning — PATTERN_NAME: detail]  one per WARNING found, max 3
